# Deploy-HAProxy-LB
This Powershell/PowerCLI script can be used to deploy the HAProxy OVA to vCenter for use by vSphere with Tanzu. It is highly recommended that you plan out your networking before installing. There are a number of items in the script that you need to configure for your environment. Don't just download and run this!

# Deploy-WorkloadManagement
This Powershell/PowerCLI script can be use to automate the setup and configuration of vSphere with Tanzu's Workload Management on vSphere clusters that use VDS networking and HAProxy or AVI for load balancing. This is not currently written to deploy Workload Management with NSX-T. 

# Get HAProxy Cert
This Powershell/PowerCLI script retrieves the CA Cert generated by the HAProxy OVA when it's installed. It converts the value found in the VM's Advanced Settings to usable text. This code is also used in other scripts but is shared here separately for those that may find it useful.
